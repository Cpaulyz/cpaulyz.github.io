 ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, this is Chen Yanze.

I'm a senior student at Nanjing University, majoring in software engineering.

I'm interested about database and distributed system. Currently, I'm focusing on sync module of  [Apache IoTDB](https://github.com/apache/iotdb) and learning [MIT6.824](https://github.com/Cpaulyz/MIT6.824).
